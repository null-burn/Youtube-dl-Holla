# Youtube-dl Holla

This is a simple Windows Application wrapper for the console application called youtube-dl. This was my first attempt at WPF so be kind. All this app really does is pass the argument values to the youtube-dl, that’s all. It was just an interface for my friend who found it difficult to use command line.

You’ll need 2 additional resources to make this application work.

1.	Download youtube-dl.exe from https://yt-dl.org/downloads/2019.06.27/youtube-dl.exe and place it in the “Youtube-dl” folder once you’ve unzipped my app.
2.	For MP3 conversion to work you also need to download the libav binaries and supporting files. To make this easy just download http://builds.libav.org/windows/release-gpl/libav-11.3-win64.7z. Copy all the files from libav-11.3-win64\win64\usr\bin to “Youtube-dl” folder.

Tested on a Windows 10 Pro 64-bit machine.
